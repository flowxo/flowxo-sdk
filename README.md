# Introduction

[Flow XO](https://flowxo.com) is a platform that lets users build automated sales & marketing workflows on top of their existing cloud apps.

Each supported service is built as a _module_ which is called by the Flow XO _core_. A service is split into separate _methods_, and each method is either a _trigger_ (looks for new records, or receives new records via a webhook) or an _action_ (creates, updates or deletes records).

We've opened up our SDK so that anyone can build support for their service into Flow XO. The SDK gives you scaffolding for your service, a command-line tool to run your methods locally, tools to write tests and some examples of working services. Not forgetting these docs which should hopefully guide you through the process.

If you get stuck, just send us an email at [support@flowxo.com](mailto:support@flowxo.com) and we'll try our best to guide you.

# Prerequisites

Flow XO runs on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). If you don't have Node.js, you can [download it here](https://nodejs.org/download/). Make sure you're using Node.js v0.12.x as that's the version we run.

You'll also need to be familiar with [Git](http://git-scm.com/) as you'll be using it to submit your service for review. We use [GitHub](http://github.com) to host the services code, and you'll need to be familiar with forking and creating pull requests, as this is the workflow we will be using to validate your service.

As most modules will be fairly thin wrappers around HTTP API's, you should understand how to make HTTP requests in Node. We encourage you to use the popular [Request](https://github.com/request/request) module, but you can choose to make requests with Node's plain [https](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html) API if you prefer.

Finally, build and test related tasks are handled by the JavaScript task runner [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) so a working knowledge of this is useful.

That's all. The other tools that the SDK uses will be installed locally with `npm install`.

# Example Services

Use our example services as a reference when building your service:

- [Trello Example](https://github.com/flowxo/flowxo-services-trello-example) - uses OAuth1 for authentication.

_(We're hoping to bring you more examples soon!)_

# Scaffolding Your Service

To make it easy to build your service, we've written a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator, which complements this SDK. You should install and use this to scaffold your service:

``` bash
npm install -g yo generator-flowxo
```

You should now be able to run `yo flowxo` to generate a service.

If you select a _Credentials_ service, you'll be asked to define the fields that the user must complete. Normally this would be a username, password, API key, token, account name, etc. Just define all the fields you'll need to collect in order to access and authorize against your service's API. See the _Authorization > Credentials_ section for more information.

If you select an _OAuth1_ or _OAuth2_ service, some skeleton configuration will be created that will need to be updated later. See the _Authorization > OAuth_ section for how to do this.

You should now have a populated directory with some scripts. Next, we'll take a look at what we've generated.

# Code Structure

A service is a collection of JavaScript files, with scripts relating to the service as a whole in `/lib`, and a directory for each method beneath that in `/methods`. You will also notice a set of files under `/tests` - these are called when testing your service.

This is how your service will eventually be structured (although you won't have any methods yet):

```
service_name
  |-- lib/ - contains service implementation
    |-- index.js - describes the service & authorization fields, and holds shared functions
    |-- ping.js - the core runs this to check authorization
    |-- methods/
      |-- method_name/
        |-- config.js - describes the method & input/output fields
        |-- run.js - the core calls this script to run the method
        |-- input.js - optional, returns dynamic input fields
        |-- output.js - optional, returns dynamic output fields
      |-- another_method/
        |-- ...
  |-- runs/  - created when test runs are recorded
  |-- tests/ - contains files used to run service for testing
```
You'll see many other files and directories, for example a `tests` directory where you can store your unit tests.

The service expects files to remain in their default locations, so try not to move things around unless you know what you are doing.

# Code Conventions

You'll notice that we use the following code conventions, and services should be written to adhere to these guidelines:

- Indent with 2 spaces
- Use single quote marks
- Line length no longer than 80 characters
- Always use semicolons
- Always wrap `if` statements in curly braces

A `.jshintrc` file is scaffolded by the generator into the root of the service module. This can be used in conjunction with [JSHint](http://jshint.com/) to ensure your code conforms to the expected code conventions. You can also run `grunt jshint` to check that your code conforms.

You can also automatically 'beautify' your code to fit these code conventions. Run `grunt jsbeautifier` to apply this to your code.

If in doubt, consult the example services for more details on the conventions that we expect.

# Requiring the SDK

``` js
var sdk = require('flowxo-sdk');
```

The SDK exposes these public properties:

- `Service`: The main service object, return an instance of this in `index.js`.
- `Error`: Contains a set of Flow XO error objects (see _Handling Errors_).

and these private ones (which you won't need to explicitly use):

- `ScriptRunner`: Used by the test runner. You shouldn't need to explicitly use this, instead, a `runner` is created automatically for you when testing.
- `Chai`: a set off assertions used for testing.

You'll only be concerned with the public properties when building your service.

# Scripts

A Flow XO service is built up of some configuration plus a number of _scripts_. `ping.js`, `run.js`, `input.js` and `output.js` all work in a similar way.

They're passed an `options` object along with a callback function `done`, which is a standard node.js ['error-first' callback](http://thenodeway.io/posts/understanding-error-first-callbacks/) function.

``` js
module.exports = function(options, done) {
  /* Do something here */
  done(err, output);
}
```

Your script receives the input and does whatever work is necessary. If all is well, the script should call `done(null, object)`. If there's a problem, tell the core about it by returning `done(err)` (see the section on _Handling Errors_).

Each type of script will be explained in more detail later.

# Service Index

The `lib/index.js` file defines the service. It looks something like this:

``` js
var service = new sdk.Service({
  serviceRoot: __dirname,
  name: 'Your Service',
  slug: 'your_service',
  auth: {
    ...
  }
});

module.exports = service;
```

The Flow XO core will `require` your service like any other node module. Our module exports only one thing - an instance of the `sdk.Service` object configured for our service.

This `index.js` file is also a great place to hold or link to your shared code, by attaching it to the `Service` object. That's because when your scripts execute, they are executed as if they were methods of the service object itself.

In the example above you'll see two important fields for defining the service. The `name` field is how the service will be presented to the user in the UI. The `slug` field is used internally by the Flow XO core, and should be a lowercase underscore-delimited string uniquely representing your service. Normally you should not need to change these generated values.

It's common to create a module that abstracts the handling of HTTP requests, and perhaps a function that handles errors. See _Recipes > Input Validation_ for an example of creating a common `service.validate` function that you can use throughout your scripts.

Take a look at the example modules to see what kind of code you should be centralising here.

# Authorization

Flow XO supports credential based auth (where the user provides some kind of secret that can be used for authorization) or the [OAuth](http://oauth.net/) protocol, where the user grants access directly through the service being accessed. Both OAuth1 and OAuth2 are supported.

## Credentials

We support authorization with credentials (an API key, token, username/password or actually any combination of fields) which are passed into your scripts at runtime and can then be used to authorize requests.

Usually that means sending credentials in the request headers or query string, or perhaps exchanging the credentials for a token before using that in requests.

To configure credentials based auth, you'll be asked to add one or more fields by the generator when initially scaffolding your service. If you need to edit these fields later on, you'll need to edit the `auth` property in the `lib/index.js` file.

For example, if you need to collect 2 fields, an API key and an account name, you should declare those fields like this:

``` js
auth: {
  type: 'credentials',
  fields: [
    {
      type: 'text',
      key: 'apikey',
      label: 'API Key',
      description: 'Find this under settings.',
      required: true
    },
    {
      type: 'text',
      key: 'account',
      label: 'Account',
      description: 'The name of your account.',
      required: true
    }
  ]
}
```

See the section _Creating Methods > config.js > Input Fields_ for a list of the field types you can use here.

When your scripts are run, you'll get the credentials in `options.credentials`.

### ping.js

A `credentials` service will be scaffolded with a `lib/ping.js` script, which needs to be implemented to check that the details provided by the user are valid. After the user has provided their credentials to connect to a new account, the core will call `ping.js` to check those credentials work.

You'll be passed an `options` object containing the credentials that the user supplied (in `options.credentials`), and like the other scripts you should either call `done()` to indicate success or `done(err)` to indicate error:

``` js
module.exports = function(options, done) {
  // Make some API call
  this.client.getUser(options.credentials, function(err) {
    if(err) {
      // We have a problem - return the error.
      return done(err);
    }

    // Otherwise, all is ok.
    return done();
  });
}
```

## OAuth

Most external API's now support authentication using OAuth and typically offer OAuth2. This is the preferred method of authentication so you should always investigate if OAuth2 is supported by the API you are working with.
We support [OAuth](http://oauth.net/) (versions [1.0a](http://oauth.net/core/1.0a/) and [2.0](http://oauth.net/2/)).

If there's a choice between credentials and OAuth, it's usually better to use OAuth, as instead of copying and pasting credentials, the user will be prompted with a browser window, asking for their username/password for the connecting service.

Flow XO relies on the [Passport](http://passportjs.org/) library for managing OAuth1 and OAuth2 authentication. If you have created an OAuth service, the generated `lib/index.js` file contains a skeleton auth configuration with enough helper text to get you started. You should update the `strategy` property with a valid Passport strategy (remember to install it first with `npm install --save`), and configure the options (`consumerKey`/`consumerSecret` for OAuth1, `clientID`/`clientSecret` for OAuth2) and params (scope, state, etc) that you need.

Twitter uses OAuth1, and so an example for a Twitter service might look like:

``` js
auth: {
  type: 'oauth1',
  strategy: require('passport-twitter').Strategy, // npm install --save passport-twitter
  options: {
    consumerKey: process.env.TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY,
    consumerSecret: process.env.TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET
  }
}
```

Facebook uses OAuth2, and so an example for a Facebook service might look like:

``` js
auth: {
  type: 'oauth2',
  strategy: require('passport-facebook').Strategy,
  options: {
    clientID: process.env.FACEBOOK_ID,
    clientSecret: process.env.FACEBOOK_SECRET,
    state: true,       // Prevent CSRF
    enableProof: true  // Support Graph API appsecret_proof
  },
  params: {
    scope: ['email','user_likes']
  }
}
```

Make sure that if the strategy requires any extra configuration, you add it to either the `options` or the `params` object. Refer to the strategy's documentation for more details on this.

_Note: you do not need to add a `callbackURL` to the options object, as the system will automatically generate a callbackURL for you. When testing the service, you'll need to setup your development machine so that the generated callback URL can be reached by the test runner. See the section Testing > Integration Tests > Authentication for more details._

You'll notice the use of [environment variables](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_env) to prevent the hard coding of the key and secret. When configuring the service, we'll provide you with these details for connecting to the service, and you should enter the details into the `.env` file for testing purposes. For more details on setting environment variables, refer to the section _Testing > Integration Tests > Authentication_.

When your scripts are run, you'll get the relevant credentials in the `options.credentials` object:

``` js
// OAuth 1
{
  credentials: {
    consumer_key: '<consumer_key>',
    consumer_secret: '<consumer_secret>',
    token: '<token>',
    token_secret: '<token_secret>'
  }
}

// OAuth 2
{
  credentials: {
    access_token: '<access_token>',
    refresh_token: '<refresh_token>'
  }
}
```

The credentials object for OAuth1 matches the structure expected by the [Request](https://github.com/request/request#oauth-signing) library, which means you can pass `options.credentials` straight into the request options:

``` js
var options = {
  url: 'http://example.com',
  oauth: options.credentials
}

request(options, done);
```

You'll need to take special care to use an _Auth Error_ when the API reports an authorization problem. That way, if the service is an OAuth2 service, the core knows to try and refresh the access token and try your script again (when possible). See the section _Handling Errors > Auth Errors_ for details.

# Creating Methods

The [Flow XO Generator](https://github.com/flowxo/generator-flowxo) contains a generator to scaffold individual methods as well as entire services. Simply run `yo flowxo:method` and follow the steps to generate a new method.

Methods are stored in the `lib/methods/` folder. Each method has its own folder with the name being the `slug` of the method. Inside each method folder you'll find `config.js`, `run.js`, and if you selected these during the scaffold, `input.js` and/or `output.js`.

## config.js

Each method has its own `config.js` file, which defines the method's name, what type of method it is, and describes its input/output fields.

A typical config file looks like this:

``` js
var config = {
  name: 'A Method',
  slug: 'a_method',
  type: 'poller',
  kind: 'trigger',
  scripts: {
    run: require('./run'),
    input: require('./input')
  },
  fields: {
    input: [...],
    output: [...]
  }
}

module.exports = function(service) {
  service.registerMethod(config);
};
```

- `type` - Accepts values of `poller` (see the section _Polling_), `webhook` (see the section _Webhooks_) or `action` (anything else).
- `kind` - Defines the method as either a `trigger` or `task`.
  - A `trigger` is a method which responds to changes in the connected service. If any new items were found, this triggers a workflow.
  - A `task` is a method which carries out an action during a workflow request. This could be creating a new record, updating an existing one, or fetching data.
- `scripts` - All methods should have a `run` script. You can reference an `input` and/or an `output` script too. Use input/output scripts to dynamically define fields that are generated at runtime and show alongside the static fields you define in the `fields` property. See the _input.js_ and _output.js_ sections for more details.
- `fields` - Contains `input` and `output` objects, defining arrays of fields that will be available for input to the script, and the properties that your script will output (on success). See the sections on _Input Fields_ and _Output Fields_ below.

### Input Fields

Input fields should be provided as an array of objects that describe what type of data the input field accepts and how it is to behave in the UI.

The most basic input field is `text`, which will be displayed to the user as a single-line `input` box.

``` js
{
  key: 'first_name',
  label: 'First Name',
  type: 'text'
}
```

Ensure that the `key` for each object in the method config is unique, including keys generated by the `input.js` script. The following is invalid:

``` js
[{
  key: 'duplicated',
  label: 'Duplicated Key',
  type: 'text'
}, {
  key: 'duplicated',
  label: 'Duplicated Key',
  type: 'text'
}]
```

You can make any field required:

``` js
{
  key: 'first_name',
  label: 'First Name',
  type: 'text',
  required: true
}
```

Note that the UI will ensure there's some kind of value in a required field, but that might be a property from another task and be empty, so you'll still need to check for empty fields within your script.

Fields can also have a default value:

``` js
{
  key: 'first_name',
  label: 'First Name',
  type: 'text',
  required: true,
  default: 'John'
}
```

It's also helpful to provide some extra description to help the user understand how to use the field. Do that with a `description`:

``` js
{
  key: 'first_name',
  label: 'First Name',
  type: 'text',
  required: true,
  default: 'John',
  description: 'You know what this is, right?'
}
```

The description is displayed underneath the field.

You can also use text areas, select boxes, special date/time fields and boolean fields.

#### Text Areas

``` js
{
  key: 'description',
  label: 'Description',
  type: 'textarea'
}
```

#### Select Boxes

``` js
{
  key: 'priority',
  label: 'Priority',
  type: 'select',
  default: 1,
  input_options: [
    {
      label: 'Low',
      value: 1
    },
    {
      label: 'Medium',
      value: 2
    }
  ]
}
```

Notice that the `default` field references the `value` of the matching `input_options`. So, in the example above, the select box will show the 'Low' item by default.

#### Date/Time Fields

``` js
{
  key: 'due',
  label: 'Due Date',
  type: 'datetime'
}
```

You can learn more about date/time fields in our [knowledge base](http://support.flowxo.com/article/9-dates-times). The field attempts to coerce any value into a [JavaScript Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date), which can then be [converted](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString) to an [ISO 8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) string. It makes it easy for users to exchange dates between services.

The value of a date/time field will always be passed into your script as an object after being processed by the core:

``` js
{
  type: 'date',
  input: 'tomorrow',
  valid: true,
  parsed: Date
}
```

You'll find the original value in `input`, a flag to say whether the date is `valid`, and `parsed` which will contain a valid date object, or an [Invalid Date].

To stringify the date into ISO 8601 format, you can use the [toISOString](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString) method on the date object:

``` js
var isoStr = date.parsed.toISOString();
```

The `date` object is automatically enhanced with the [sugar.js library](http://sugarjs.com). You are free to use the [Sugar Date API](http://sugarjs.com/dates) on your parsed dates. Everything apart from [ranges](http://sugarjs.com/dates#ranges) is supported.

For example, if you wanted to output a date object in a particular string format:

``` js
var formattedStr = date.parsed.format('{yyyy}-{MM}-{dd}');
// -> 2015-04-14

```

_Note: by default, sugar.js also enhances other JavaScript objects, such as `Number`, `String` and `Array`. Flow XO uses a [customised version](https://github.com/fiznool/sugar-date) of sugar.js which only enhances the `Date` prototype._


#### Boolean Fields

``` js
{
  key: 'active',
  label: 'Active',
  type: 'boolean',
  input_options: [ // Optional
    { value: 'true', label: 'Yes' },
    { value: 'false', label: 'No' }
  ]
}
```

If you don't specify `input_options`, the options will default to _Yes_ and _No_.

A boolean field type will attempt to coerce a select box value into `true` or `false`. It can handle the values `true`, `false`, `yes`, `no`, `1` or `0`.

It's similar to date/time in that the value passed to your script will always be an object:

``` js
{
  type: 'boolean',
  input: 'yes',
  valid: true,
  parsed: true
}
```

You'll find the original value in `input`, a flag to say whether the boolean is `valid`, and `parsed` which will either contain `null`, `true` or `false`.

Boolean fields are most useful for custom inputs, where the `input_options` are generated from the connected service's API.

#### Field Dependencies

An input field can be configured as a dependant of another field. This signals to the dependant field that its configuration should be loaded _dynamically_ - that is, according to the value of the parent field.

This is useful for relational data, where the value of one field governs the options and/or default value of the other. You'll mostly be configuring Select Boxes as dynamic fields.

This concept is best explained with an example:

- Consider a set of sports leagues, with each league containing different teams. This can be modelled with two select boxes: _league_ and _team_.
- The options for the _league_ select box are fixed. The options for the _team_ select box are dynamic, and depend upon the value of _league_.
- Initially, the _league_ select box has no value selected, and so the _team_ select box has no options (and will be automatically hidden by the core UI).
- When a value is selected for the _league_ select box, this value is used to calculate the options for the _team_ select box.
- Each time the _league_ value is changed, new options are loaded for the _team_ select box.

To signal that a field has dependencies, list each dependant field's key in the `dependants` array:

``` js
{
  key: 'league',
  label: 'League',
  type: 'select',
  input_options: [
    { value: 'prem', label: 'Premier League' },
    { value: 'champ', label: 'Championship' }
  ],
  dependants: ['team']
}
```

Note that you _should not_ list the dependant field in `config.js`, this should instead be returned as a custom field from `input.js`.

You'll be using the `input.js` script to calcluate and return the dependant field, rather than listing it in `config.js`. See the section _input.js > Loading dependant fields_ for more details.

### Output Fields

Output fields should be provided as an array of objects that describe what data the script will output (its output 'properties').

Each property is described like so:

``` js
{
  key: 'email',
  label: 'Email Address'
}
```

Similar to input fields, output `key`s should be unique, including keys generated by the `output.js` script.  You should describe all properties that your script _might_ output.

If a script outputs nested data, you should describe your keys using 'double underscore notation':

``` js
{
  user__id: 'User ID',
  user__name: 'User Name'
}
```

Note that the SDK will take care of flattening and unflattening the actual data, so you do not need to worry about implementing this. Simply refer to your nested data using the double underscore notation, and the SDK will take care of the rest. See the section _Double Underscore Notation_ for more details.

## input.js

Sometimes it's necessary to generate fields at runtime. As an example, if our method has an input _User_, then it's usually best to load up a list of users into a select box rather than expect a user ID. We won't know who those users are until the account has been authorized, and that list might change from time to time.

So the way forward is to use an `input.js` script. The script is very similar to `run.js`, except it either returns an error, or an array of input fields on success. See the section _Input Fields_ for the format of the array you should return.

### Loading Dependant Fields

If your service includes dependant fields, `input.js` is also the place where you'll be calculating the dynamic configuration of the field.

You'll know that `input.js` is being run to load a dependant field by the presence of a `target` property in the input data. If `target` is present, check the `target.field` property to determine the field that changed, and find the field's new value in `target.value`. Combine this information to load the dependant field(s).

_Note: when calculating and returning a dependant field, don't return any other custom fields. The core will take care of merging the newly configured dependant field with the rest of the input fields._

Here is an example of loading a dependant field.

``` js
// config.js
...
fields: {
  input: [{
    key: 'league',
    label: 'League',
    type: 'select',
    input_options: [
      { value: 'prem', label: 'Premier League' },
      { value: 'champ', label: 'Championship' }
    ],
    dependants: ['team']
  }]
}
...


// input.js
'use strict';

module.exports = function(options, done) {
  var teamOptions = [];

  var target = options.input && options.input.target;

  if(target) {
    // Try to fetch the team options.
    if(target.field === 'league') {
      // In real life, we'd likely now hit an API
      // to fetch the teamOptions, but here just
      // fill in with dummy data.
      if(target.value === 'prem') {
        teamOptions = [{
          label: 'Chelsea',
          value: 'chelsea'
        }, {
          label: 'Manchester United',
          value: 'man-utd'
        }];

      } else if (target.value === 'champ') {
        teamOptions = [{
          label: 'Bristol City',
          value: 'bristol-city'
        }, {
          label: 'Nottingham Forest',
          value: 'notts-forest'
        }];
      }
    }
  }

  done(null, [{
    key: 'team',
    label: 'Team',
    description: 'Select the team.',
    required: true,
    type: 'select',
    input_options: teamOptions
  }]);
};

```

Notice that the `teamOptions` is only populated if the `target` input is present. Otherwise, the team field is returned with empty options.

## output.js

`output.js` scripts are executed at runtime and augment the static output fields defined in the `config.js`.

Use an output script where the service supports 'custom fields'. For example, many [CRMs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) allow administrators to define extra data fields alongside standard fields such as name, phone, etc.

The script is very similar to `run.js`, except it either returns an error, or an array of output fields on success. See the section _Output Fields_ for the format of the array you should return.

Note that `options.input` will hold the input values that the user has given to the method. Any `{{outputs}}` from other tasks in those values will be replaced with empty strings.

## run.js

This is the primary script of the method. Like every other script, you'll be passed an `options` object and `done` (a callback). The script should do its work and either call `done(err)` or `done(null, output)`.

``` js
module.exports = function(options, done) {
  /* Do some stuff */
  done(null, [Object]);
}
```

The `options` object contains the following properties:

``` js
{
  credentials: {
    /* auth credentials */
  },
  input: {
    /* input values */
  },
  logger: {
    /* winston.js logger */
  }
  // triggers only....
  poller: [Function]
}
```

The `output` object should be the data returned by the method.

For pollers, return an array of objects - each object will be classed as one new piece of data, and will trigger a request.

``` js
// poller output
[{
  id: 1,
  key: 'Some Value'
}, {
  id: 2,
  key: 'Some Other Value'
}]
```

In the example above, 2 objects have been returned, and so this will trigger 2 workflow requests, one for each object.

For actions, return a single object of data.

``` js
// action output
{
  key: 'Some Value',
  some: {
    nested: 'data'
  }
}
```

All the keys that your script might output should be included in the output fields described in the method's `config.js` (or `output.js`). Remember that nested data should be described using double underscore notation, e.g. `some__nested` (for the object above).

## Double Underscore Notation

Output data in Flow XO can be referenced in your output fields using _double underscore notation_.  For example, take this data returned from an API:

``` js
{
  name: 'My deal',
  people: [
    {
      name: 'John Doe',
      phone: '0207 000 0000',
      email: 'john.doe@example.com'
    },
    {
      name: 'Jane Doe',
      phone: '0208 000 0000',
      email: 'jane.doe@example.com'
    },
    {
      name: 'Jim Smith',
      phone: '0800 000 000',
      email: 'jim.smith@example.com'
    }
  ],
  meta: {
    status: 'Open',
    assigned: true
  }
}
```

This object's data can be referenced using these keys:

``` js
{
  name: 'My deal',
  people__0__name: 'John Doe',
  people__0__phone: '0207 000 0000',
  people__0__email: 'john.doe@example.com',
  people__1__name: 'Jane Doe',
  people__1__phone: '0208 000 0000',
  people__1__email: 'jane.doe@example.com',
  people__2__name: 'Jim Smith',
  people__2__phone: '0800 000 0000',
  people__2__email: 'jim.smith@example.com',
  meta__status: 'Open',
  meta__assigned: true
}
```

So to include output fields for _Deal Name_ and _Deal Person_ in your method's `config.js` or `output.js`, you would use:

```
[{
  key: 'name',
  label: 'Deal Name'
},
{
  key: 'people__0__name',
  label: 'Deal Person'
}]
```

You'll see that arrays are indexed from 0 - so `people__0__name` refers to the `name` property in the first item of the `people` array. Some APIs may return an arbitrary number of items in an array, but the config only supports addressing a fixed amount. Enter as many indexes as is reasonable for the particular service you are developing.

_Note: when implementing your scripts, expect and return data in regular 'nested' form, i.e. don't worry about flattening or unflattening data. The double underscore notation is only used for the output configuration._  

## Polling

Flow XO supports 2 trigger mechanisms: __polling__ and __webhooks__. Polling involves hitting an API periodically to check for new items, and is the most popular way of building a trigger. Polling is more resource intensive than webhooks, but they're much easier for users to set up (currently users have to manually configure webhooks).

At present, polling triggers are checked every minute. Sometimes your method will be called just to populate the cache of existing records (when the workflow is initially set up by the user, when it's changed or after the workflow is reactivated).

The polling process is actually quite straightforward:

1. Fetch a time ordered list of items from the API (newest first). Set a sensible limit on the number of results, 10, 25 or 50 results is usually enough.
2. Pass the array of items to `options.poller`, along with a string referencing the property that holds the unique ID for each item in the list, and finally a callback.
3. Your callback will be passed an array of new items (or an empty array), which can then be processed further and passed back as the result.

You can define your method as a polling trigger in `config.js`:

``` js
var config = {
  name: 'A Polling Trigger',
  slug: 'a_polling_trigger',
  type: 'poller',
  kind: 'trigger',
  ...
}
```

Polling scripts will be passed a special function in their `options.poller` property, which will take care of a lot of the work:

``` js
options.poller(data, key, function(err, newItems) {
  // if newItems has length, new data is available
});
```

All you need to do is give it a list and tell it what property within each list item holds the ID. A callback is fired with an array of new items.

- `data` (Array) - An array that is to be checked for new items. This will often come directly from an API, but you may need to pick out the property containing the list of items.
- `key` (String) - The property that holds the unique ID for each item in the list. For example, on [Twitter's `user_timeline` endpoint](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/statuses/user_timeline), each tweet that's returned contains an `id_str` property which is the unique ID for the tweet. In this case, set the key to `id_str`.
- `function(err, newItems)` - The error-first callback function is called with an error if a failure occurred, or otherwise a `null` error and an array containing the new items found (those with a key that hasn't been seen before). The array will be empty if no new items are found.

Internally, the `options.poller` function asks the database whether each key has been seen before, and if not, adds it to the array of items it returns. The core will then update the cache of items once it's handed the list of new items.

To see polling triggers in action, study our example services (see the _Example Services_ section).

## Webhooks

Flow XO has general [webhooks support](http://support.flowxo.com/article/22-webhooks), but methods within services can be triggered by webhooks too.

Users follow a similar process to setting up general inbound webhooks:

1. They're given instructions of how to set up the webhook and given the webhook URL to copy and paste.
2. Once it's in place, they fire off a test webhook.
3. We receive the test and complete the set up.

To define your method as a webhook trigger, set your `config.js` up like this:

``` js
var config = {
  name: 'A Webhook Trigger',
  slug: 'a_webhook_trigger',
  type: 'webhook',
  kind: 'trigger',
  scripts: {
    run: require('./run')
  },
  fields: {
    output: [...]
  },
  help: {
    webhook: {
      config: [
        'Copy the webhook URL to your clipboard.',
        'In your account, go to settings and paste it in.'
      ],
      test: [
        'Create a new record to test your webhook.'
      ]
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

This configuration will automatically be scaffolded when you choose a _Webhook Trigger_ from the list when running `yo flowxo:method`.

### Fields

A webhook trigger cannot supply any input fields, but it should define its expected output fields in the configuration. This should match up with the format expected to be sent by the service.

### Run Script

Notice that a webhook trigger also has a `run.js` file, just like a poller trigger or an action. This allows you to manipulate the data received from the webhook before triggering a workflow, into the format defined by the output fields config.

As an example:

``` js
// config.js
{
  ...
  fields: {
    output: [{
      key: 'fullname',
      label: 'Full Name'
    }]
  }
  ...
}

// run.js
module.exports = function(options, done) {
  var received = options.input;

  // Manipulate the received data into the format we expect
  var data = {
    fullname: received.first_name + ' ' + received.last_name
  }

  done(null, data);
};
```

The `run.js` script is mandatory for a webhook trigger. If you don't need to manipulate the data, simply pass it straight through.

``` js
module.exports = function(options, done) {
  done(null, options.input);
};
```

### Help Instructions

You should provide a `help` property to tell the user how to configure the webhook in your service. `help.webhook.config` and `help.webhook.test` accept an array of paragraphs which will be displayed to the user when the service is being set up.

# Handling Errors

The callback for your script expects either an error (if the request failed) or an object (on success). This section will help you to understand how to construct your errors.

## Retryable Errors

These occur when you can't access a service or you get a response back in a format that you don't recognise, and are the default error type. They're usually recoverable, and so the platform will retry the request later.

When you encounter a retryable error, return a regular JavaScript error as the error argument in your callback. Either create a new one (`new Error()`) or hand back the error object passed in from a library such as `request`.

You should use a retryable error in situations like these:

- HTTP requests fail. For example, where you use `request.post()` to call the API and your callback receives an error object.
- Where you receive a 500 status code from the API, and you were expecting 200.
- If you receive a 200 status code (as expected) and test for the presence of a `result` JSON key in the body, but find that it's not there.
- A `JSON.parse` of the API's response throws an error.

Depending on the situation, you can either return an error object directly, or create a new error:

- `done(err)` (problem connecting to API)
- `done(new Error(response.statusCode + ' ' + body))` (some kind of temporary error reported by API)
- `done(new Error('Could not parse: ' + body))` (API returns invalid JSON)

It's up to you what information your error contains, but make sure it describes the problem. The user will never see these error messages, they're logged and monitored by Flow XO.

The core will retry the request up to 5 times (with exponential back-off), and if after the 5th attempt a retryable error still occurs, it will be written to the workflow log as "The request failed because something unexpected happened.".

If you are in doubt about what error to return, use a retryable error, to give the script the best possible chance to succeed.

## Service Errors

Service errors are where a user's request can't be completed for operational reasons. This includes validation errors, objects not being found, quotas being exceeded, etc.

The core does not make any attempt to retry after a `ServiceError`. Instead, the error message provided with the `ServiceError` is written to the workflow log, and the error object is logged and monitored by the core.

If you run into an error, create a `ServiceError` object and return it as the error argument in your callback:

``` js
cb(new sdk.Error.ServiceError('You must provide a value.'))
```

There might also be times where you'd like to include an error object along with your message for debugging purposes, although the error itself won't be shown to the user:

``` js
cb(new sdk.Error.ServiceError('You must provide a value.', err))
```

Take care with the tone and style of the message passed to your `ServiceError`, as it will be displayed directly to the user.

## Auth Errors

A special case is where the API returns an error relating to authorization (usually when a REST API returns a status code `401`).

Use an instance of `AuthError`, which is very similar to `ServiceError`. If the service is authorized with OAuth2, the platform will attempt to refresh the OAuth token and retry the request once. If that doesn't succeed, or if the service is not authorized with OAuth2, the error will be written to the workflow log.

Take care with the tone and style of the message passed to your `AuthError`, as it will be displayed directly to the user.

## Example

Here's a commonly used pattern for dealing with errors in a `request` callback. In this case, our API broadly follows [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) principles, and uses OAuth:

``` js
var ServiceError = sdk.Error.ServiceError,
    AuthError = sdk.Error.AuthError;

request(options, function(err, response, body) {
  if(err) {
    // Pass back the error. This will be classed as 'retryable';
    return done(err);
  }

  if(response.statusCode >= 200 && response.statusCode <= 299) {
    // 2xx means it was a success!
    return done(null, body);
  }

  var errorMessage = body && body.message;

  if(response.statusCode === 401) {
    // A 401 is an Unauthorized error.
    // By passing back an AuthError, if the service is OAuth2,
    // an attempt will be made to refresh the access token,
    // and the script will be retried. Otherwise, the error
    // will be logged and the workflow request will be aborted.
    return done(new AuthError(errorMessage || 'Authorization error'));
  }

  if(response.statusCode >= 400 && response.statusCode <= 499) {
    // 4xx is a client error. There was probably an issue
    // with the input data, so it does not make sense to retry
    // the request.
    return done(new ServiceError(errorMessage || 'An error occurred when sending data to the service.'));
  }

  // Count any other status code range as a retryable error,
  // giving the script the best possible chance to succeed.
  // This could include:
  //  - 3xx: redirects.
  //  - 5xx: a server error. This is usually temporary.
  done(new Error(errorMessage || body || 'unknown error'));
});
```

In practice, you'll probably want to wrap this logic up into a centralised `errorHandler` function in `lib/index.js`.

# Authorized Libraries

Each service is manually reviewed before we make it available in Flow XO, and part of that process is making sure that only authorized libraries are used in your scripts.

We do this for security and stability reasons, and also so that we can help developers without having to learn a different library each time.

If you need a library that isn't on this list, please get in touch so we can review it.

- [async](https://github.com/caolan/async) - Async utilities
- [request](https://github.com/request/request) - Simplified HTTP request client
- [xml2js](https://github.com/Leonidas-from-XIV/node-xml2js) - XML to object conversion
- [validate.js](http://validatejs.org/) - Validating javascript objects (commonly the input data)
- [q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) - Promise library
- [lodash](https://lodash.com/) - JavaScript utility library

If you are developing an OAuth service, you'll also need to use a passport strategy. Find yours from the [list of providers](http://passportjs.org/guide/providers/).

# Updating a Method

Once a method is made available, it can't be changed or deleted, only deprecated (and usually replaced with a newer version). This is because there may be users which have workflows configured with the old method, and we don't want to break their workflows by removing it.

To deprecate a method, simply set `{ deprecated: true }` in the `config.js`. You can then create a replacement method with a versioned slug `{ slug: 'a_method_v2' }` (it's OK to use the exact same `name` in your new version, only the `slug` needs to be unique). A deprecated method will not be available for selection when the user is configuring a new trigger or action, but will still be available for existing workflows.

Of course, you'll need to submit a Pull Request (PR) to the main `flowxo`-owned repo to have the changes made live.

# Testing

There are two types of testing that are supported by the SDK: unit tests and integration tests.

## Unit Tests

[Unit testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) allows you to test each unit of your code in isolation. This facilitates [Test Driven Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), and helps to modularise your codebase. Unit tests stub out the service's API, typically using a library such as [nock](https://github.com/pgte/nock) to mock the response. For this reason unit tests are often fast, and can be run automatically.

Unit tests are for your own benefit, and are not mandatory for the service to be submitted for validation.

### Writing Unit Tests

Unit test files are stored in the `tests/` folder at the root of the service. A test file has the `.spec.js` file suffix. By default, some tests are scaffolded when the service is created, and when new methods are added. These tests will need to be updated by you as, untouched, they will fail.

The default layout is to have one test file per method and additionally one service-level test, but you are welcome to organise them as you wish (all `.spec.js` files under the `tests/` folder will be picked up automatically wherever they are located).

Tests are standard Node.js [mocha](http://mochajs.org/) tests, supported by [chai](http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/), [sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) and [sinon-chai](https://github.com/domenic/sinon-chai).

A number of useful things are available to your test scripts:

``` js
describe('A Spec', function() {
  it('is a spec', function() {
    // Get the service
    var service = this.service;

    // Check the service configuration is valid.
    expect(service).to.be.a.flowxo.service;

    // Run a service script
    var serviceScript = 'ping';
    var serviceOptions = {
      input: {
        // Input data goes here
      },
      credentials: {
        // Credentials go here
      }
    }
    this.runner.run(serviceScript, serviceOptions function(err, output) {
      // `err` if there was an error running the script
      // otherwise `output` contains the script's output
    });

    // Run a service script without options
    this.runner.run(serviceScript, function(err, output) {
      // `err` if there was an error running the script
      // otherwise `output` contains the script's output
    });

    // Check method configuration is valid
    var methodSlug = 'some_method';
    var method = service.getMethod(methodSlug);
    expect(method).to.be.a.flowxo.method;

    // Run a method script
    var methodScript = 'run'; // One of 'run', 'input', 'output'
    var methodOptions = {
      input: {
        // Input data goes here
      },
      credentials: {
        // Credentials go here
      }
    };
    this.runner.run(methodSlug, methodScript, methodOptions, function(err, output) {
      // `err` if there was an error running the script
      // otherwise `output` contains the script's output
    });

    // Run a method script without options
    this.runner.run(methodSlug, methodScript, function(err, output) {
      // `err` if there was an error running the script
      // otherwise `output` contains the script's output
    });

    // Initialise the poll cache with empty data.
    // Important if you expect a poller method to respond to 'new' data,
    // since by default the script runner will populate the poll cache
    // on first run.
    this.runner.setPollerCache(methodSlug, []);
  });
});
```

Refer to the example services for more details on how to architect your code to be unit testable. In particular, try to follow these guidelines:

- Concentrate on providing small blocks of code, which can be fed inputs, and return outputs. This will make unit testing easier.
- Mock the service's API using a library such as [nock](https://github.com/pgte/nock), so your unit tests do not require 'real' data to run. This will ensure your tests will run fast, as there will be no network latency.

### Running Unit Tests

```
# Run your specs
grunt test

# Watch code for changes, and automatically run specs
grunt watch
```

## Integration Tests

[Integration testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing) emulates how the Flow XO platform will use your service, using the live API. You complete the input data and the method's `input.js`, `output.js` and `run.js` scripts are run in order, passing the provided data through and displaying the results. You can also record a series of integration tests, and replay them in order.

You'll need to record a series of integration tests to demonstrate that the service is operating correctly. These will be replayed and validated when you submit the service. For this reason, integration testing is mandatory.

### Setup

Prior to running integration tests, you'll need to initialise the test environment:

```
grunt init
```

### Authentication

Since your integration tests will be hitting the service's API, before running the tests, it's important to generate some authentication credentials. This is achieved using the command

```
grunt auth
```

Once acquired, the credentials are stored in a file `credentials.json`, and are used for all integration tests. This file __should not__ be committed to version control - an entry in the `.gitignore` file takes care of this.

You'll acquire credentials in a different way, depending on the service.

#### Basic Credentials

If your service authenticates with basic `credentials` (e.g. API key), you'll be prompted to enter the details on the command line.

Once all details have been filled in, the service's `ping.js` script is run, to validate that the credentials are correct. Ensure this has been implemented correctly, otherwise the credentials won't be stored.

#### OAuth

If your service autheticates via `oauth1` or `oauth2`, running `grunt auth` will open a browser window, where you'll need to enter your username/password to authenticate with the service. We'll provide you with these login details.

Prior to running `grunt auth`, there are a few things you'll need to configure.

Firstly, configure the consumer key and secret (for OAuth1) or client ID and secret (for OAuth2). We'll provide you with this information, which you should add to the `.env` file. It's important that these details are only added to the `.env` file, and nowhere else - they should be treated as confidential and __not committed to version control__.

Secondly, since OAuth relies on redirecting the browser window to a URL hosted by our server, in order to complete the auth flow, you'll need to setup a hostfile redirect on your machine. The consumer key / client ID and secret we provide you with will link to an account with an OAuth `redirect_uri` set to `http://flowxo-dev.cc:9000`. This means that you need to ensure that when the browser redirects to this address, it accesses your machine. The easiest way to do this is to add an entry to your hostsfile (`/etc/hosts`) with the following line:

```
127.0.0.1   flowxo-dev.cc
```

_Note - you may be wondering why we don't just use `http://localhost:9000` or `http://127.0.0.1:9000`as the `redirect_uri`. Unfortunately, some OAuth providers do not allow `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`, and so we have invented a fake TLD to use instead._

### Running Integration Tests

You run an integration test with

```
grunt run
```

This will prompt you for the method to run, along with the input data, and will then run the `input.js`, `output.js` and `run.js` scripts, in that order, if available. The end result will be displayed to the screen, with the option to run another method, or end.

You can also run a single method script:

```
grunt run --single
```

### Recording Integration Tests

You can record a series of integration tests with

```
grunt run --record
```

In this mode, your input actions are captured, so they can be replayed later with

```
grunt run --replay
```

Your actions are captured to the `runs/` folder, to a file `runs.json`. You can specify the name of this file to record to / replay from:

```
grunt run --record --name=bob
grunt run --replay --name=bob
```

Note that subsequent calls to `grunt run --record` will append to your existing actions, rather than overwrite them. If you need to start a fresh set of actions, you'll need to clear the file manually.

The `runs/` folder can be committed to version control, allowing others the chance to replay tests you have recorded. Bear in mind that they will often need to be authenticated as the same user as you in order to replay the tests successfully.

### Testing Pollers

The first time an integration test is run for a poller, you'll see no data returned from the service. This is due to the way that pollers work: the first time the API is hit, the pollcache is filled with all existing data from the service.

To simulate a poller finding new data, you will therefore need to:

- Run a poller method.
- Run a 'create data' method, or manually create new data in the service.
- Run the poller method again.

The pollcache is stored in memory, one per method. This has the following implications:

- If you end a `grunt run`, the pollcache will be cleared.
- Poller methods will use their own individual caches, meaning that you need to run each poller method once to initialise its pollcache.

# Recipes

The Flow XO SDK and the services scaffolded by the Flow XO Generator try to be as non-opioniated as possible, not forcing you to take one approach over another. Below are some common 'recipes' you may find helpful in your code.

## Input Validation

Where possible, we recommend that you leave detailed input validation up to the API you are dealing with - just send the data you've got and ensure that your response handling code covers any validation errors.

However there can be times when some simple validation of the input will immediately reveal an error is going to occur before continuing, saving a roundtrip to the service.

For example, if you are writing a `get_person` method, and your `run.js` script is going to construct the following URL to query:

``` js
var personUrl = 'https://my.service.com/persons/' + options.person_id
```

If `options.person_id` is `undefined`, or contains spaces, or isn't alphanumeric, we should immediately abort.

To perform this sort of validation, the SDK provides a set of helper methods based on the [validate.js](http://rickharrison.github.io/validate.js/) library.

There are two methods available on the service:

- `service.validate`: exposes the `validate.js` object and therefore provides the entire `validate.js` API.
- `service.validateScriptInput(data, constrainsts, options)`: runs the passed data through the validator, returning any errors as an instance of `sdk.Error.ServiceError`. This is a convenience wrapper around the `service.validate` method, which is useful for validating script input data, as any returned error can be passed straight to the `done` handler of the script.

Here is an example of using the `validateScriptInput` method in a script.

``` js

// run.js

module.exports = function(options, done){
  // Input validation
  var inputErr = this.validateScriptInput(options.input, {
    person_id: { presence: true, numericality: true }
  });

  if(inputErr){
    return done(inputErr);
  }

  // Else carry on safe in the knowledge options.person_id is
  // there and is a number
}
```

The built-in validator applies some sane defaults to `validate.js`, namely:

- format: 'flat'
- fullMessages: true

### Validating Datetime and Boolean Fields

The SDK also provides two custom validators for dealing with Flow XO Datetime and Boolean fields. Use them as follows:

``` js
// run.js

module.exports = function(options, done){
  // Input validation
  var inputErr = this.validateScriptInput(options.input, {
    required_due_date: { fxoDatetime: { required: true } },
    optional_due_date: { fxoDatetime: true },
    required_boolean: { fxoBoolean: { required: true } },
    optional_boolean: { fxoBoolean: true },
  });

  if(inputErr){
    return done(inputErr);
  }

  // ...
}
```

## Request Client

If the service you are accessing has a RESTful API, it can often be beneficial to streamline the request sending and response handling into a single function, and pass in parameters depending on the endpoint to be reached.

We call this a 'client' connector. See below for an example.

``` js
// client.js

var request = require('request'); // npm install --save request

function ServiceClient(credentials) {
  this.credentials = credentials;
}

ServiceClient.prototype._request = function(options, done) {
  var opt = {
    url: url.format({
      protocol: 'https',
      host: 'my.service.com',
      pathname: options.path,
      query: options.query || {}
    }),
    oauth: this.credentials,
    headers: {
      Accept: 'application/json',
    },
    method: options.method || 'GET',
    json: options.json || true
  };

  request(opt, function(err, res, body) {
    if(err) {
      // Retryable error - possibly network related.
      return done(err);
    }

## Mocking API Calls

The integration test runner is designed for and encourages you to connect to your _real_ service in order to validate your service performs as expected. Whilst this is obviously a crucial part of integration testing, it can be undesirable for a unit test to establish a connection to a remote server.

For unit testing, one approach is to try and structure your service code into separate units that can be tested independently. By mocking calls to the API, these individual units can then be tested in isolation, without the need for a connection to the live API.

A useful library for mocking APIs is [nock](https://github.com/pgte/nock). An example test case:

``` js
'use strict';

var sdk = require('flowxo-sdk'),
    nock = require('nock');

// Before each test, reset nock
beforeEach(nock.cleanAll);

describe('Get Person',function(){
  it('should throw authentication error on 401', function(done){
    // Setup our mocked 401 response
    var scope = nock('https://my.service.com')
                .get('/persons/1')
                .reply(401);

    this.runner('get_person', 'run', { input: {person_id: 1} }, function(err, output){
      expect(err).to.be.defined;
      expect(err).to.be.instanceof(sdk.Error.AuthError);
      expect(scope.isDone()).to.be.true;
      done();
    });
  });
});
```

# Submitting your Service

Before you submit your service to us, please work through this checklist:

- Share details of a developer/test account with us, ready to run your tests through (include details in `README.md`).
- Make sure your service has good unit tests.
- Include a set of `grunt run` tests that we can `grunt run --replay` to see your methods working well.  We need to see your methods dealing with a variety of input (both valid and invalid). It's best to [get in touch](mailto:support@flowxo.com) with us at this stage so we can explain what you need to do here.
- Run `grunt preflight` to ensure that your unit tests all pass, code conforms to the specified code conventions, and is 'beautified'.
- If there's anything else we need to consider when reviewing your service, it should be included in `README.md`.

To submit, please [email us](mailto:support@flowxo.com) with details of the service you've built and your contact details, and we'll explain what to do next. Thanks for supporting Flow XO!
